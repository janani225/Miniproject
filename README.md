# Certificate Verification and Storage System with Blockchain

## Project Overview

This project is a **Certificate Verification and Storage System** designed to securely store and verify educational certificates using **blockchain technology** and **digital signatures**. The system allows educational institutions to issue and verify certificates digitally, ensuring authenticity and preventing forgery. The system is built using **Python** with **Tkinter** for the graphical user interface (GUI) and **SHA-256** for digital signature generation.

## Features

- **Save Certificate**: Allows users to save a certificate along with a digital signature in the blockchain.
- **Verify Certificate**: Verifies the authenticity of a certificate by checking its digital signature against the blockchain.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Uses a simple blockchain implementation to store certificate details securely.
- **GUI Interface**: Provides a user-friendly interface using Tkinter for certificate management.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**: The programming language used to implement the system.
- **Tkinter**: Used to create the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **SHA-256**: Used to generate digital signatures for certificates.
- **Blockchain**: Implements a basic blockchain to store and manage certificates.
- **Pickle**: Used for serializing and saving blockchain data to a file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually comes with Python)
- hashlib (included in Python standard library)
- Pickle (included in Python standard library)

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
